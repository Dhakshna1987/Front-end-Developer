JS ES6 Modules
--------------

Modules allow you to break up your code into separate files for functions or variables can be stored in.

This makes it easier to maintain a code -base

Modules are created by using statements are

import:
   - To import from other modules

export:
 
   - Available for other modules

Note:- 

. Moduels also rely on type="module" in the <script> tag.
. Modules only work with the HTTP(s) protocol.

.When you import a module into a main javascript file, the module's code is executed first before the code in the main file. This is because the module needs to be evaluated and its exports made available before the main file can use them.

Names Export
// 1. inline - indivudually
export let name = "congnizant";

// 2. All at once
const name = "congnizant"
let year = 2023;

export { name, year };

Default Export | only one in a file

const great = () => {
    console.log("Good morning");
}
export default great;

Module Import:
=============
Named exports | import by using curly braces.

import { name, year } from "./module.js";

Default Exports | import without curly braces

import greet from "./greet.js";
