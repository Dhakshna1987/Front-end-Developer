Non - Primitive Data types
--------------------------

=> Non-primitive data types are data types that are not primitive values. meaning they do not contain a single value.
=> Non-primitive data types are also reffered to as reference types and objects.
=> They are created by the programmer and store collections of data.

Here are some example of non-primitive data types in Javascript.

. Objects
. Arrays
. Functions
. Date


Objects
-------

The object data type is used to store collections of data, such as key-value pair or arrays.

 For Example.

let person = {
    name: 'surya,
    age: 23,
    hobbies: ['coding', 'traveling']
};

Arrays
------

The array data type is  a type of object that stores a collection of data in an ordered list.

For example

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let actors = ['surya', 'vijay', 'rajini']
 
Functions
---------

A Function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are used to organize code and make it reusable.

For example

function greeting(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}`)
}

greeting();

Date
-----

The date data type is used to store date and time values.

for example

let today = new Date();
console.log(today)
