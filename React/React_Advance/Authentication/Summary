How do you implement authentication in a React application? 

Authentication can be implemented using strategies like JWT (JSON 
Web Tokens), OAuth, or integrating with third-party services like 
Firebase or Auth0. This involves managing user sessions, storing 
tokens, and protecting routes with higher-order components or 
hooks.
