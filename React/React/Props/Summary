What is Props?
--------------
 Props in a React App as act a gateway of communication between the parent and child Components.
 Props are used to pass data from parent to child component. Props are simply properties.
 Every component has a props object by default. If we see in the console, we will get to know that props is an object.
 Props are read only, meaning that they cannot be modified by the child component.


Define Props
-----------
//parent component

const Parent = () => {
    const name = "tech buddies"
    return <Child name = {name} />
}

//Child component 
 const Child = (props) => {
    return <h1> Hello, {props.name}! </h1>
 }
