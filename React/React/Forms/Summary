React Forms
-----------
React handles forms using controlled components, where form elements like <input> are controlled by React state, making it easier to manage user input and form submission.

Form State Management
---------------------

React allows you to create state variables to hold the current values of form inputs.

You can use hooks like useState or state management libraries the Redux to manage the form data.

By updating the state variables when the form inputs change, you keep track of the user's input.


Handling Form Events
--------------------

React provides event handlers that allow you to respond to user interactions with the form.

The most common event handler is onChange, which fires whenever the value of an input field changes.

By capturing and updating the form state with each onChange event, you can keep the form data up to date.
