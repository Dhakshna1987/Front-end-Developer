Folder Structure
----------------

A typically React project follows a common folder structure that organize the codebase.

-> My-App
  > node_modules
  > Public
  > src
     > .gitgnore
     > package-lock.json
     > package.json
     > README.md


src: This is the main folder where most of your project's code resides.

  . index.js: The entry point of your application
  . App.js: The root component that gets rendered in the browser.
  . components: This folder contains reusable and smaller components used in the project.
  . pages: This folder contains larger components that represent different pages or views of your application
  . styles: CSS or stylin-related files, including global styles and component-specific styles.
  . assets: Static assets such as images, icons, or fonts used in your application.
  . utils: Utility functions or helper modules that are used throughout the project.
  . services: This folder holds any services or Api-related files.

public: This folder contains static assets that don't require processing, such as the HTML file.

node_modules: It is automatically created when you install dependencies.

package.json: This file lists the project's metadata and dependencies, including scripts for running various tasks.

package-lock.json: These files are automatically generated and lock the versions of your installed dependencies, ensuring consistent builds across different machines.

.gitignore: This file specifies which files or directories should be ignored by version control (e.g. Git)

.README.md: A file containing information about the project.
