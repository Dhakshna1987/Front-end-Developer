State
=======

State in React is an object that holds data that can change, and it is managed by a component.
It is used to store and update the components data and can be passed down to child components as props.

State can be updated using the setState method. which triggers a re-render of the component, updating the user 
interface.

constructor() {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
        count : 0;
    }
}

class FirstComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(){
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            count : 0;
        }
    }

   render(){
    return <div>Hello {this.state.count} </div>
   }
}

export default FirstComponent;
