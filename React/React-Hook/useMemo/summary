useMemo()
---------

useMemo is a hook that allows you to memozie a value.
It is used to optimize the performance of a component by only re-computing a value if its dependencies have changed.
This can be useful for avoiding expensive calculations or rendering operations.


const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

useMemo accepts two arguments:
A function that computes the value.
An array of dependencies. The function is only re-executed when one of these dependencies changes.
