Redux-Saga;

redux-saga is a library that allows you to handle side effects in the redux application by using generator functions.
It provides way to handle async actions and to separate the logic for handling side effects from the rest of the app.

The main idea behind Redux-Saga is to have sagas that listen to Redux actions and decide when to run side effects. 
These sagas are functions that yield objects to the middleware, which interprets the yielded objects and performs 
the necessary operations like dispatching actions, making API calls, etc.

Key Concepts of Redux-Saga:
Effect: Describes side effects (e.g., making an API call).
Watcher Sagas: Listen for dispatched actions and start worker sagas.
Worker Sagas: Perform the side effects when a particular action is dispatched.
yield: A way to pause the generator function.
