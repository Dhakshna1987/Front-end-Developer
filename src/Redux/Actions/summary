Actions 
-------- 
Actions are used to send data from the application to the Redux store.
A typical action consists of the type property and an optional payload property.

Reducers 
-------
— This is a function that accepts the current state and action as arguments and 
returns the updated state according to the action.

Store 
----
— This is the heart of Redux where the state is stored. 
The state is kept in plain JavaScript objects and arrays.


Middleware
-----------
Middleware in Redux is a function that sits between the action being dispatched and the action reaching the reducer

Each middleware function receives the `store`’s `dispatch` and `getState` methods, allowing it to interact with the state and dispatch new actions.

Thunks: 
-------
Thunks are a way to write async logic that interacts with the Redux store. They allow you to dispatch actions and access the state.
