------

Redux  JS library for predictable and maintainable global state management.
Redux is a library for managing the state of an application. It provides a centralized store to hold the state.


Why Should I Use Redux?
-----------------------

Centralized state management: 
With Redux, you can maintain the state of your entire application in a single store,making it easier to manage
 and access data across components.

Predictable state updates: 
Redux has a clear flow of data, which means changes to the state can only happen when you create an action and 
send it through Redux. This makes it easy to understand how your application’s data will change in response 
to user actions.

Easier debugging: 
With Redux DevTools, you have a clear record of all the changes to your application’s state. 
This makes locating and fixing issues in your code easier, saving you time and effort in the debugging process.

Better performance: 
By minimizing the number of state updates and reducing the need for prop drilling, 
Redux helps improve your application’s performance.
