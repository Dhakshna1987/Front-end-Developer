Redux thunk
-----------

Redux Thunk is a middleware for Redux that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. This is particularly useful for handling asynchronous logic (like API calls) in a Redux application.


How Redux Thunk Works

Without Thunk: Action creators return plain action objects (synchronous).
With Thunk: Action creators return a function (instead of an object), and inside that function, you can perform asynchronous operations and dispatch actions when needed.
