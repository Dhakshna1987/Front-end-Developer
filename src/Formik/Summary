Formik:

Formik is a popular open-source library for building and managing forms in React applications. It simplifies handling form state, validation, and submission, reducing the complexity that comes with managing forms manually in React. Formik is particularly useful for larger and more complex forms where managing input states and validation rules can become tedious.

Key Features of Formik:

Form State Management:
 Automatically manages form state (such as form values, touched fields, and errors) without needing to write a lot of boilerplate code.

Form Validation:
 Supports form validation via both synchronous and asynchronous validation methods. It can easily integrate with validation libraries like Yup for schema-based validation.

Form Submission:
 Provides simple form submission handling with built-in methods for submission success or failure.

Handles Edge Cases: 
Manages various edge cases like form reset, validation on blur/change, and nested form fields with ease.

Why Use Formik:
Easier Form Handling: 
It abstracts much of the repetitive form-related code, making forms simpler and more maintainable.

Declarative Approach: 
It allows developers to handle form validation and submission declaratively in a React-friendly way.

Flexibility: 
Works well with complex forms, and integrates easily with other form validation libraries like Yup.
