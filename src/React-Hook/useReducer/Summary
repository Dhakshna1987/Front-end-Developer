useReducer()
-------------

The useReducer Hook is similar to the useState Hook.

useReducer is a built-in hook that provides an alternative way to manage state in functional components

It is particulary useful when dealing with complex state logic or when the state transitions depend on previous states.
The useReducer hook follows the reducer pattern, similar to how Redux manages state using reducers.

Syntax:
------
useReducer(<reducer>, <initialState>)

reducer function: Contains your custom state logic. A function that takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns the new state.

initialState: can be a simple value but generally will contain an object. When the component is mounted for the first time.

useReducer() | Returns
======================

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer()

The useReducer Hook returns the current state and a dispatch method.

.State: The current state value returned by useReducer.

.dispatch: A function that allows you to send actions to the reducer. It takes an action object as an argument and trigger the state update.
