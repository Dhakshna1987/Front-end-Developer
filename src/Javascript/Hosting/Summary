Hoisting
=========

Hoisting in Javascript is a behavior in which a function or variable can be used before declaration.

. In terms of variable and constant keyword var is hoisted, and let and const doesn't allow hoisting.

//Example with var
console.log(x) //undefined
var x = 10;

//Example with let
console.log(x) //throw an error
let x = 10;

//Example with const 
console.log(x) //throw an error
const x = 10;
