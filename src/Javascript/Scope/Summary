Scope
=====

Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects and functions.

.In Javascript a variable has 3 types of Scope
  . Block Scope
  . Function Scope
  . Global Scope


  Global Scope:
  -------------

  A Javascript global scoped variable is defined outside the function and block.

  Such variable is accessible anywhere in the code.


  Example:
   
   let name = 'John'
   let age = 24

   function myName(name) {
    console.log(name)
   }

  myName(); // John

   if(2 < 4) {    
    console.log(age) //24
   }

   Function Scope
   =============

   A variable is said to be function scoped if it is defined within a funciton

   Var is a function scoped. i.e you can to access it outside the function

   function intro () {
    var age  = 26
    console.log(age)
   }

   intro() // 26

   console.log(age) // age is not defined

   Blocked Scope
   =============

   The block scope of a variable means that variable is accessible within the block that is between the curly braces

   You can't access it outside the block

   if( 2 < 3) {
    const name = "rose"
    console.log(name); // rose
   }

   console.log(name) // name is not defined
