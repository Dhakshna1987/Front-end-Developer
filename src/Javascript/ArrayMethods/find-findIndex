find()
The find method is also similar to the some() method but doesnâ€™t return a booleanâ€”it will instead return the first element that passes a test. Like the some() and every() method, it also executes the callback function for every element and will return undefined if no element passes the test. Its syntax is also similar to both methods.

// Syntax
myArray.find(callbackFn)

let students = [
    { name: "John Doe", age: 22 },
    { name: "Jane Doe", age: 33 },
    { name: "Karl Don", age: 21 }
];

console.log(students.find((student) => student.name === "John Doe").age); // 22


findIndex()
This method is very similar to the find() method, but this time, instead of returning the element, it returns the index (position) of the first element in the array that passes the test function. It will return -1 if nothing matches. Its syntax is similar to the find() method.

// Syntax
myArray.findIndex(callbackFn)

let students = [
    { name: "John Doe", age: 22 },
    { name: "Jane Doe", age: 33 },
    { name: "Karl Don", age: 21 }
];

console.log(students.findIndex((student) => student.name === "Jane Doe")); // 1
