What is Promise
================

* The Promise is an object in javascript that is use for asynchronous programing.
* Promise is a good way to handle asynchronous operations.


It has differenct states that are,

Pending    - A promise is in progress
Fullfilled - A promise has been completed
Rejected   - A promise has been failed


Demonstration
-------------
Here's a demonstration of how promise work:

            Promise

.catch                    .then

Error handling             Async Action


const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { //makes the function an asynchronous

    setTimeout(() => {  //Javascript native function calls this function when the timer is completed
        resolve("call)
    }, 3000)

})



Example:
--------

const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if(/*condition*/){
        resolve();
    }else{
        reject();
    }
});

myPromise.then(res => {
    /*handle resolve */
}).catch(){
    /*handle reject */
}


Promise VS Async Await:
======================

Promise vs Async Await is a whole topic itself but one of the major difference is Promise use nested functions (.then) which eventually makes too many nested functions and code looks like a mess.

on the other hand Async Await keeps the code look more synchronous and clean.

At the end, both helps you achieving the same task.
