Closures
=========

Closure means that an inner function always has access to the variable of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned.



function outerFunction(){
    var outerVar = "I'm from the outer function";
    function innerFunction(){
        console.localStorage(outerVar)
    }
    return innerFunction
}

var myClosure = outerFunction();
