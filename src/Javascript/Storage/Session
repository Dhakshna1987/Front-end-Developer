SessionStorage
==============

SessionStorage is a web api allows web applications to store key-value pairs in a similar way to localStorage.

The difference is that SessionStorage stores the data only for duration of a single browsing session, while localStorage stores data indefinitely or until it is manually cleared.


This Web Api makes it ideal for storing temporary data that needs to persist within the current browsing session.
