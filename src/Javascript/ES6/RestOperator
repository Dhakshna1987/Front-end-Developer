Rest Operator:
=============

The Rest operator is denoted by three dots (...)

It is used to make a new array or object from the remaining parts of an array or object.

Let's take an example

const books ['bookA', 'bookB', 'bookC']

const {firstBook, ...otherBook} = books

firstBook -- It will contain first bookA
otherBook -- rest operator, it will contain remaing parts


function sumAllNumbers = (...numbers) => {
    let sum = 0;

    for (const number of numbers){
        sum += number
    }

    return sum;
}

cosnt result = sumAllNumbers(1,2,3,4);
console.log(result); //10
