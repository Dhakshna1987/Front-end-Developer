What Is JSON
-------------

-> JSON (Javascript Object Notation) is a lightweight human-readable data interchange format commonly used for transmitting and storing data.
-> It is widely used in web applications and has become a popular choice for representing structured data.
-> JSON syntax is derived from Js, but it is language-independent, meaning it can be used with any programming language. It uses key-value pairs to organize data into a hierachical structure.

JSON | Object
------------

An object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces {}.

Each key is a string, followed by a colon:, and then a value pairs are separated by commas. Objects allow you to represent complex data structure.

{
    name: "code tech",
    Year: 2022,
    city: "Chennai"
}

JSON | Array
------------
An array is an ordered collection of values enclosed in square brackers. []

Values in an array can be of any valid JSON type, including objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null. 

Array elements are separated by commas.

["applie", "banana", "orange"]

JSON | Differenct Values

1. String

string values should be enclosed in double quotes("). Single quotes(') are not considered valid for defining string values in JSON.

2. number

JSON doesn't differentiage between  different number format (e.g., integers, floats, scientific, notation).

3. Boolean -- true, false

4. null
