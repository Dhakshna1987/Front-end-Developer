Async & Await
============

Stop and wait until something is resolved.

 * We use the async keyword with a function to represent that the function is an asynchronous function.
 * The async function returns a promise.

 const  showPost  = async() => {
    const res = await fetch ("https://xyx.com/posts)
    return res.posts
 }


 console.log(showPost());
