//What is different  between ForEach vs Map In Javascript

ForEach
=======

The forEach() method calls a function for each element in an array. 
The forEach() method is not executed for empty elements.

Syntax
-----
forEach(currentElement, indexOfElement, array) -> )

let arr = [1,2,3]

const returnVal = arr.forEach((ele) => ele * ele) // [1,4, 9]



Map
---

.Map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element 

let arr = [1,2,3]

const returnVal1 = arr.Map((el) =>  el * el) // [1, 4, 9]
