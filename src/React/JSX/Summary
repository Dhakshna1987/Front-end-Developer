JSX
----
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript code. It is commonly uses JSX to describe what the UI should look like. 


Browser cann't read JSX file directly. They must be transpiled, or converted, to Javscript before they can be interpreted by the brower


import React from 'react';

function Greeting() {
  const name = 'John Doe';
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Greeting;
