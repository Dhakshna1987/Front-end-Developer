What is Prop Drilling?
----------------------

Prop drilling refers to the process of passing data from a parent 
component to deeply nested child components via props. It can be 
avoided using the Context API, which allows you to pass data 
without passing props through every level of the component tree

Prop Drilling | Example

App
  |  --ParentComponent
     | --ChildComponent
       | --GrandchildCompoent

Prop Drilling | Process

prop drilling process look like:

. App component has the data that GrandChildComponent needs.

. App passes the data as a prop to ParentComponent.

. ParentComponent passes the same data as a prop to ChildComponent

. ChildComponent finally passes the data as a prop to GrandchildComponent.

Solution:

.React Context API or
. useContext Hook with React
. Redux
. Mobx
