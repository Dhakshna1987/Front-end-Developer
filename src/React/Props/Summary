What is Props?
--------------
Props(properties)in React are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
They are essentially a way to pass data and methods down the component tree.
Props are read only, meaning that they cannot be modified by the child component.

//parent component

const Parent = () => {
    const name = "tech buddies"
    return <Child name = {name} />
}

//Child component 
 const Child = (props) => {
    return <h1> Hello, {props.name}! </h1>
 }
