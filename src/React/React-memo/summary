React.memo
----------

In React, React.memo() is a higher-order component that optimizes performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders 
of functional components.  

Usage of React.memo()
The React.memo() function takes a component as an argument and returns a memoized version of that component. 
If the props are the same between renders, React will reuse the last rendered output, skipping the rendering phase.
