External CSS Files
==================

You can also use traditional external CSS files and import them into your components.

In this case, you import the css file and add the corresponding class names to your JSX elements. The styles defined in the external CSS file will be applied globally.

import "./styles.css";

<div className="container">Hello world </div>
