CSS-in-JS Libraries
===================

CSS-in-JS libraries are a popular approach for styling in React.js that allows you to write css directly in your javascript code.
Such as styled-components, 

import styled from "styled-component";

const StyleDev = styled.div`
color: red;
front-size: 16px;
`;

<StyleDev> Hello Word </StyleDev>
