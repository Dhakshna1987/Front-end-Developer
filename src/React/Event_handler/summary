Event handling in React is similar to handling events in DOM 
elements, but with some syntactical differences. For example, 
React events use camelCase syntax, and you pass the event 
handler function without parentheses


In React, a Synthetic Event is a cross-browser wrapper around the browserâ€™s native event system. It provides a consistent API regardless of the browser, combining the best features of native events and abstracting away differences across browsers.

import React from 'react';

function App() {
  const handleClick = (event) => {
    // This is a synthetic event
    console.log('Synthetic Event Type:', event.type);

    // You can access native event properties
    console.log('Native Event:', event.nativeEvent);

    // Prevent the default behavior
    event.preventDefault();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, React Synthetic Event!</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
