Router:
------
React Router is a popular library for managing client-side routing in React applications.
React Router is a crucial tool for building dynamic, single-page applications in React. 
It provides a seamless way to manage navigation, routing, and user interactions within your web application. 

Key Concepts
------------
Route:
 A route is a mapping between a URL and a component. When a user visits a specific URL, React Router renders the corresponding component.

Router: 
The router is the top-level component that provides the routing infrastructure. In React Router, you typically use BrowserRouter for web applications and HashRouter for static sites.

Nested Routes:
 React Router allows you to nest routes, creating a hierarchy of components. This is especially useful for layout structures.
 
Link: 
The Link component enables navigation by creating anchor-like elements that maintain the application's state.


Explain the difference between static and dynamic routing in React. ?

Static routing defines routes at build time and does not change, 
whereas dynamic routing allows routes to be generated dynamically 
based on application state or user input.
